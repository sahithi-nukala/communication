// This is for internal use only, not part of public API, so we can hide it from crate level docs.
#![doc(hidden)]

//! Mock implementation of FFIBridge using mockall for type-safe, per-test configuration.
//!
//! This provides a mockall-based mock where tests can configure expectations locally.
//! Uses a hybrid approach: mockall for most methods, with a wrapper for lifetime constraints.
//!
//! # Components
//!
//! ## SharedMockBridge
//! Wrapper that allows all clones to share the same underlying mock instance and expectations,
//! eliminating the need for complex clone expectation setup in tests.
//!
//! ## MockPointerAllocator
//! Helper utility for managing FFI pointer allocations in tests. Eliminates the repetitive
//! `Arc<Mutex<Vec<Box<T>>>>` pattern and provides automatic cleanup tracking.
//!
//! # Usage
//! ```ignore
//! use bridge_ffi_mock::{MockFFIBridge, SharedMockBridge, MockPointerAllocator};
//!
//! let mut mock = MockFFIBridge::new();
//! // Use MockPointerAllocator for cleaner pointer management
//! let skeleton_alloc = MockPointerAllocator::<SkeletonBase>::new();
//! let skel = skeleton_alloc.clone();
//! mock.expect_create_skeleton()
//!     .returning(move |_, _| skel.allocate());
//!
//! let bridge = SharedMockBridge::new(mock);
//! // All clones automatically share the same expectations
//! let clone1 = bridge.clone();
//! ```
//!
//! # With Call Sequencing
//! Use `mockall::Sequence` to enforce call ordering:
//! ```ignore
//! use mockall::Sequence;
//!
//! let mut mock = MockFFIBridge::new();
//! let mut seq = Sequence::new();
//!
//! let skeleton_alloc = MockPointerAllocator::<SkeletonBase>::new();
//! let skel = skeleton_alloc.clone();
//! mock.expect_create_skeleton()
//!     .in_sequence(&mut seq)
//!     .returning(move |_, _| skel.allocate());
//!
//! let event_alloc = MockPointerAllocator::<SkeletonEventBase>::new();
//! let evt = event_alloc.clone();
//! mock.expect_get_event_from_skeleton()
//!     .in_sequence(&mut seq)
//!     .returning(move |_, _, _| evt.allocate());
//!
//! // Enforces: create_skeleton must be called before get_event_from_skeleton
//! ```
//!
//! This mock back-end is used for unit testing of Lola-Runtime.
